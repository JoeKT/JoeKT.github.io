            <h1>Mobile App: Memory Bowl</h1> 
            <h2>Case Study Overview</h2>
            <p>The concept of a memory bowl is a physical container into which people (often a romantic couple) place small notes, photos, and other memorabilia of their shared time together; when they wish to reminisce, they draw memories from the bowl, either individually or together. The goal of the app is to take this concept and create it digitally while broadening the scope to easily include groups of more than two and presenting the option for bowls to become social interactions (shared and/or made public). The format still preserves the random access of memories from a collection but also now presents the option to display those memories in an organized, scrapbook-esque fashion.</p>

              <h2>Persona One: Molly Lazzari</h2>
              <h3>Archetype: Social butterfly</h3>
              <p>Molly is a high school student with a large social group from her various extracurricular activities. She has a boyfriend and a younger sister with whom she spends the majority of her time.<br><br>Most of her memory bowls would feature her closest realtionships: boyfriend, sister, best friend. She would also enjoy creating one for her soccer team that is on the way to the championship this year. There is also an awesome party coming up at Eva's and lining a memory bowl to the facebook group would be a great way to remember everything.</p>
              <p><strong>Must Haves:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Lots of customization options</li>
                  <li>Allow the create to grant and/or revoke access to memories for specific people</li>
                  <li>Integrate with social media</li>

              <h2>Persona Two: Frederick Siegl</h2>
              <h3>Archetype: Avid Traveler<h3>
              <p>Frederick travels a lot and is usually documenting his trips on his phone. He collects small trinkets from every location with an interest in displaying them someday. He finds the idea of trip scrapbooks cool but has never been motivated to actually create any.<br><br>Frederick would create memory bowls for each trip and share them with travel partners, friends going to the same place, and perhaps his blog followers.<br><br>He would want to choose the order pictures were displayed, number/placement on the "page", style and background, and perhaps add captions/text outside pictures. If viewers chose to randomly draw memories from the bowl, he wouuld want to set a generic template and assign unique captions to display with each picture.</p>
              <p><strong>Must Haves:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Robust functionality offline</li>
                  <li>Smooth integration with phone camera and photo library</li>

              <h2>Persona Three: Tam Knopp</h2>
              <h3>Archetype: Novice User<h3>
              <p>Tam is going to Washington, D.C. with her class to visit the Smithsonian museums for the first time. The whole class is really excited but also afraid they won't be able to remember everythin to share with their families and friends back home.<br><br>Tam volunteered to create a group memory bowl but she does not want the responsibility of choosing a theme or creating everything herself. She absolutely does not want to type in everyone's information to share the bowl.<br><br>She does have their phone numbers and is facebook friends with them though. Ideally each individual would request an invite to the bowl from Tam.</p>
              <p><strong>Must Haves:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Possibility of high number of collaborators on a single bowl</li>
                  <li>Each collaborator could style the memories they added or pages they created</li>
                  <li>Easy to understand controls and customization</li>

            <h1 class="text-wrapper">Paper Test Findings:</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Users want a significantly greater percent of their memories to be text only</li>
              <li>Creation of a text memory should be possible from the Caputre screen (3.0)</li>
              <li>The toggle between text and photograph in the Photo Capture Screen (3.2) lacks clarity and prominence</li>
              <li>Future testing will benefit from colored screens as several items caused confusion in grey scale</li>
              <li>Some users expressed concern that it was "too much like [existing social media]"</li>
              <li>The stand in icon/branding was caused some confusion</li>
              <li>The use of the memory bowl icon at the top center of the screen to return to the home screen (1.0) was not understood; this maybe be due to the placement or the lack of an icon users could identify with the application/brand</li>
