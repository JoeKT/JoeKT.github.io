        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <h3><strong>less math, more dragons</strong></h3><br>
        <p>My first design project was back at the beginning of elementary school; the teacher allowed us to decorate our desks and so my mantra became less math, more dragons. Soon the entire desk (top, front, and sides) was covered in dragon pictures. The teacher, realizing his mistake, had us switch desks. I carefully took down all of my art and carried it with me to each new desk for the rest of the year and I haven’t left a good design behind since.</p><br>
        <h3><strong>message to convey...talk to people</strong></h3><br>
        <p>In high school I was fortunate in that I received traditional art training at the collegiate level from a professor from VCU (the number one public art school in the US). I learned the importance of clarifying a design verbally and pictorially in many repetitions before approaching any higher quality production. I was taught to work with negative and positive space, 2 and 3-dimensions. Most importantly, I learned if there was a message to convey, to discern if it came across when I first started sketching by talking to people.</p><br>
        <h3><strong>if the audience wasn't able...to become part of the world, it wasn't interactive</strong></h3><br>
        <p>Studying theatrical design at the College of William and Mary took my understanding of design research and feedback to a whole new place.  There are few design types as interactive as theatrical. We used to joke that after completing a prototype for some prop or piece of scenery, it should be taken outside and thrown around because if it can break, an actor will break it on stage. Of course, having actresses clambering all over my designs wasn’t the only interaction they needed to serve. Taking a script and all of the various director, designer, and actor requirements and putting it all together after a minimum of 2 rounds of in-depth research, 2 rounds of sketching and storyboarding, 2 rounds of drafting, modeling, and then construction took thousands of hours and, at the end, if the audience wasn’t able to suspend their disbelief and become part of the world we built, it wasn’t interactive in the most important way.</p><br>
        <h3><strong>for me design has never been about the media, it’s been about people and stories</strong></h3><br>
        <p>Since graduation, I've taken up freelance design work because I wanted to work on other stories too. I helped a technology start-up on their quest to modernize a service industry; I worked on literal stories for a publishing company and as a ghostwriter. Even working in a bakery, I used the anthropology skills I picked up when not in the theatre at William and Mary to research, test, and design an inventory system and do business analysis for investors. Those are stories too. For me design has never been about the media, it’s been about people and stories.</p><br><br>
        <h1>My Process</h1>
        <h3>Research</h3><br>
        <p>Every design is telling a story, whether it's love or increased industrial efficiency, and stories are only compelling if you can believe them. That's why every design starts with research: talking to people (clients, users, friends, experts) is research, surveys are research, discussing your napking sketch at the bar with a friend can be research if it provides design insight. Reading and studying existing competition is also research. Without doing all of these things, it's impossible to know the true requirements for the design or the best strategies. Lists are crucial to my research; I tabulate everything I learn, the do's and the don't's and then begin to eliminate or restrict these into categories. Only once I have some requirements I am confident in is it time for</p>
        <h3>Wireframing</h3><br>
        <p>Categories and requirements are great, but a whiteboard of lists isn't a finished design. Now it's time to consolidate those words into pictures. Quick sketching allows for quick changes in a collaborative environment and the production of many options for feedback instead of wasting time jumping straight to photoshop. When some good sketches are created that meet the requirements, it's time for</p>
        <h3>Mock-ups</h3><br>
        <p>Now is the time for more in-depth design media (typically digital) to create something that has more definate lines than sketches, includes color, and can be easily replicated and ajusted for feedback. Mock-ups are ready for wider feedback gathering than wireframe sketching, should the project require more research or preliminary testing. Mock-ups are followed by more mock-ups until a design is chosen as the final direction for the project. The later rounds of mock-ups can become more detailed and polished as nuaces need to be worked out. Once ever requirement and client is satisfied, it's time for</p>
        <h3>The Finished Product</h3><br>
        <p>Here's when work starts on the real deal; once the prototyping and mock-ups are done. It's time to build everything out and with all the careful planning it's straightforward and any chages should be minimal, even in the details. At this point the people and the story are clear and it's time to craft a vehicle. </p>
