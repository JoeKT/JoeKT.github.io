          <h2>Persona One: Molly Lazzari</h2>
          <h3>Archetype: Social butterfly</h3>
          <p>Molly is a high school student with a large social group from her various extracurricular activities. She has a boyfriend and a younger sister with whom she spends the majority of her time.<br><br>Most of her memory bowls would feature her closest realtionships: boyfriend, sister, best friend. She would also enjoy creating one for her soccer team that is on the way to the championship this year. There is also an awesome party coming up at Eva's and lining a memory bowl to the facebook group would be a great way to remember everything.</p>
          <p><strong>Must Haves:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Lots of customization options</li>
              <li>Allow the create to grant and/or revoke access to memories for specific people</li>
              <li>Integrate with social media</li>
            </ul>

          <img src="images/frederick.png" style="height : 140px; width : 140px; border-radius: 100%;">
          <h2>Persona Two: Frederick Siegl</h2>
          <h3>Archetype: Avid Traveler</h3>
          <p>Frederick travels a lot and is usually documenting his trips on his phone. He collects small trinkets from every location with an interest in displaying them someday. He finds the idea of trip scrapbooks cool but has never been motivated to actually create any.<br><br>Frederick would create memory bowls for each trip and share them with travel partners, friends going to the same place, and perhaps his blog followers.<br><br>He would want to choose the order pictures were displayed, number/placement on the "page", style and background, and perhaps add captions/text outside pictures. If viewers chose to randomly draw memories from the bowl, he wouuld want to set a generic template and assign unique captions to display with each picture.</p>
          <p><strong>Must Haves:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Robust functionality offline</li>
              <li>Smooth integration with phone camera and photo library</li>
              <li>Ability to import and export photos</li>
            </ul>

          <img src="images/Tam.png" style="height : 140px; width : 140px; border-radius: 100%;">
          <h2>Persona Three: Tam Knopp</h2>
          <h3>Archetype: Novice User</h3>
          <p>Tam is going to Washington, D.C. with her class to visit the Smithsonian museums for the first time. The whole class is really excited but also afraid they won't be able to remember everythin to share with their families and friends back home.<br><br>Tam volunteered to create a group memory bowl but she does not want the responsibility of choosing a theme or creating everything herself. She absolutely does not want to type in everyone's information to share the bowl.<br><br>She does have their phone numbers and is facebook friends with them though. Ideally each individual would request an invite to the bowl from Tam.</p>
          <p><strong>Must Haves:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Possibility of high number of collaborators on a single bowl</li>
              <li>Each collaborator could style the memories they added or pages they created</li>
              <li>Easy to understand controls and customization</li>
            </ul>
