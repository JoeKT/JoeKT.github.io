        <div class="col-md-6"><p>An understanding of scope and space are incredibly important across all aspects of design. So is understanding sometimes it's going to be wrong. That's where measures like this perspective drawing come into play; a rough drafting of each element of the design, layered with a perspective grid, allows for a glimpse of the final product before commiting to the more intensive parts of the design process. By adding character sketchs for scale reference and lighting effects, such a storyboard snapshot can also be used to showcase the design to directors/producers/other designers.</p></div>

        <div class="col-md-6"><p>I was taught hand-drafting before learning AutoCAD and I garnered a much greater understanding of the process because of that. This groundplan for <em>Beauty Queen of Leenane</em> was the 4th round of designing the show. Before being able to layout the scene like such, the script was studied in great detail and all of the requirements listed. Then came extensive research on all aspects of the show and auxillary themes the director wished to include. After having the knowledge to make sure whatever was create would be correct, blocking (traffic flow analysis for the actors) and quick scenery sketches were completed to rough out any and all ideas. The best of these ideas were compiled and drafted with perfect precision to 1/4" scale to create a detailed map for design production.</p></div>

        <div class="col-md-6"><p>After drafting and polishing the above groundplan, a model may be constructed. This additional round of designing came only after the guaruntee that the current plan was the final choice. Every piece of scenery and furniture were drafted in 1/4", as well as the theatre housing the show. Each of these pieces was copied and then used to construct this white model, which displays exactly what an audience member will see. Scenes may be played out to help fine-tune the positioning of furniture and actors but this model marks the end of the prototyping process for design and everything enters full-scale production.</p></div>

        <div class="col-md-6"><p>For this production of Marisol I was both the scenic and projection designer. Working in with 2 directors and 3 other designers required great clarity in my designs as I had to make sure they were cohesive with the over-all aesthetic. The small space of our studio theatre required simple designs that could have very different looks with slight, quick adjustments and the short distance of the audience to the set created the need for an unusually high level of detail and cohesion of design to make the world seem real. While balancing all of this, I also had to find the line between portraying a powerful script, sometimes terrifying, filled with very loaded topics. My designs came in 85% under budget (allowing another designer to purchase additional equipment) and ahead of schedule that a week and a half of bad weather delays saw us still on schedule.</p></div>
