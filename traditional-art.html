          <div class="col-md-6"><p>Researching, testing, and sketching a design many times before committing to any involved and precise rendering will yield much better results. It's not just about subject and layout either; the sole purpose of this sketch was to test the interaction of acrylic paint, pastels, charcoal, and ink for compatability. </p></div>

          <div class="col-md-6"><p>Perhaps my favorite medium, pen and ink allow me to focus on the details of a piece to a degree like no other. Of course such detail-oriented work requires a clear, strong understanding of the design before diving into the creating. Pen and ink also requires a firm grasp of different line types, weights, and textures, which is what I was practicing in this sketch.</p></div>

          <div class="col-md-6"><p>Learning what tools and techniques to use for different effects is an important part of learning to design. I knew that painting wasn't a strong skill of mine, nor did it hold much interest to me. So when I was required to create an acrylic self-portrait, I turned to paint sticks. Still acrylic and allowing for the blending techniques of paint, these sticks allowed me to paint in a style which fit my skill set of drier media.</p></div>

          <div class="col-md-6"><p>For this acrylic self-portrait I chose to paint with a palette knife instead of a brush; the bold, sharp strokes increased the emotional feel of the piece while providing a level of abstraction that complimented the unusual face I was making. Details and precision are important but sometimes they get in the way.</p></div>

          <div class="col-md-6"><p>My first wireframing project! This plaster replica of my arm was built atop a mesh wire frame before being detailed with pastel, soder, and denim. While not directly related to wireframing for web apps or graphic design, training in 3-dimensional art helped foster my understanding of spacial relationships in design and expanded my studies of the positive/negative space dichotamy.</p></div>
