        <div class="col-md-6"><p>I was working on a cover art project (parts of which can be seen below). I needed a geometric emblem and so headed down to the library for research material. After sketching motifs from styles ranging from ancient China to Alfonse Mucha the top left of these emblems caught the client's attention. Based on an Islamic pottery sun design, I simplified the emblem and created a cover mock-up.</p></div>

        <div class="col-md-6"><p>This emblem was created for a video game team preparing to compete in a tournement. They requested a design that reflected their name: Hydrogen Trioxide. My research did not yield much of use and so I asked for clarification on what the emblem meant to the team. I was given the descriptors "blue" and "swirly". The next day I presented a set of sketches encompassing a wide range of "blue/swirly" designs and then refined the one picked.</p></div>

        <div class="col-md-6"><p>A contract for a publishing company required the creation of cover art for an anthology collection. I created 4 first-round mock-ups in Photoshop to showcase different ideas and gather feedback. This is one of those for mock-ups, based loosely on the support system for a roof as it provided strong, geometric shapes. After feedback, the patterning was toned down and a higher-fidelity mock-up was created with cleaner lines.</p></div>

        <div class="col-md-6"><p>For the same cover art contract as the above piece, this was a third-round, high-fidelity mock-up. This layout had been selected by the client and this was one of ten high-fidelity mock-ups with different texturing and unique color schemes. The simplified emblem from the top of the page did end up in the final piece as well.</p></div>
